# US_Accidents_EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis on US Accidents in Python

The dataset can be found on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents?datasetId=199387&sortBy=voteCount

This dataset provides data about accidents in the US between February 2016 and December 2021 and covers 49 states. It is a very large dataset with around 2.8 millions records.
Through an EDA in Python, I was able to obtain several valuable insights on US accidents which I will be sharing below.
Before presenting my insights, it is important to note that the state of NY was omitted from the dataset. As NY and particuly New York City is not present, the data fails to represent accidents in one of the major city in the US.
